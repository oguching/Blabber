# Blabber
Simple Twitter-like service.

This is a toy project, just a scratch the infernal itch (something is going round).
I need a service where I can just dump my ideas, something I control, something lightweight.
It will not replace all of the services I use right now.
It is just for me.
Will use markdown and have a list of posts.

I wrote a [blogpost](http://oguching.com/blog/blabber) about what I mean.

I work better with deadlines so I'm setting a deadline of October 31, 2016.

Wish me Luck
